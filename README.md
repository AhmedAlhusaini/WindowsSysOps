## 📌 ArcGIS Enterprise System Requirements

### 🔹 **ArcGIS Enterprise Overview**

ArcGIS Enterprise is **Esri’s server-based GIS platform** for mapping, spatial analytics, and data management. It demands a rock-solid IT backbone—**Windows SysOps** provides that backbone.

ArcGIS Enterprise is a powerful **server-based GIS solution**, requiring a stable **IT infrastructure** for **data storage, processing, and web-based applications**.  
Successful deployment depends on **meeting key system requirements**, which **Windows SysOps knowledge ensures**.

### 🔹 **System Requirements for ArcGIS Enterprise**

To deploy ArcGIS Enterprise, organizations must meet the following **technical requirements**:

#### 🖥 **Operating System**

✅ Supported Versions → **Windows Server 2016, 2019, and 2022**.  
✅ Windows Update → Regular patching to ensure security and compatibility.  
✅ Server Roles → Must support IIS for web-based management components.

#### 🌐 **Networking Requirements**

✅ **DNS Configuration** → Ensures proper domain resolution for ArcGIS services.  
✅ **Firewall Rules** → Requires **port configurations** for secure communication.  
✅ **SSL/TLS Certificate Management** → Secures web applications and user authentication.  
✅ **Load Balancing & Proxy Configurations** → Enhances performance across multi-server deployments.

#### 💾 **Storage & Database Requirements**

✅ **Minimum Disk Space** → At least **50GB**, but recommended **100GB+** for large datasets.  
✅ **ArcGIS Datastore (PostgreSQL, SQL Server, or Oracle)** → Proper database setup for GIS data storage.  
✅ **Backup & Disaster Recovery Strategy** → Ensures high availability and data integrity.

#### 🔐 **Security & Authentication**

✅ **Active Directory Integration** → Used for role-based access control (RBAC).  
✅ **Identity Provider Support** → Integrates with **OAuth 2.0, SAML, or LDAP** for enterprise authentication.  
✅ **Group Policy Management** → Enforces security best practices on Windows Server deployments.

### 🔹 Key Requirements & Windows SysOps Responsibilities

| 📋 Requirement                   | 🛠️ Windows SysOps Responsibility                                    |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Windows Server 2016-2022**     | Install, harden, patch, and maintain the OS                         |
| **Active Directory Integration** | Configure RBAC & single-sign-on                                     |
| **DNS / DHCP / Firewall Rules**  | Provide name resolution, IP management, and secure ports            |
| **SSL/TLS Certificates**         | Deploy and renew certificates for HTTPS & federation                |
| **Storage & Backup**             | Design RAID arrays, snapshots, and disaster-recovery plans          |
| **Performance Monitoring**       | Tune with Server Manager, Performance Monitor, Windows Admin Center |
| **Load Balancing / Proxy**       | Configure IIS ARR, Network Load Balancing, or external appliances   |

> 🏗️ Without **Windows SysOps**, an ArcGIS deployment risks instability, insecurity, and poor performance.
